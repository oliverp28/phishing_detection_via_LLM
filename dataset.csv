Hi Chris,  

Tonight we are rolling out a new report.  Currently, only you and Jon have access to it.  You'll select it off the main reports menu.  It will say ""NGX Download report"".  When you launch it, it will show the data on screen like all other reports.  There is a button at the bottom that says ""Export"".  Clicking it will give you several selections.  Choose the one that says ""Save to NGX XML"".  You can then save it as a file which can be mailed to NGX.  

Let me know if there is anyone else who needs access.

Thanks!

We have contacted Pat Priestley regarding obtaining the following data for the ISO audit.

We requested two sets of data.  One set which includes daily detail source data from a sample of meters before the application of distribution loss factors and load profiles, and a second set which includes the daily detail meter data that is summed within the SQMD file.  

For each UDC we requested data from 2 meters from each rate class (1 actual meter and 1 estimated meter).  In addition we requested 5 Enron meters from each UDC from different rate classes. The meter data should be taken from 2/15/00, 6/11/00, 7/15/00, 8/7/00, 12/28/00, respectively.

Pat has notified us that a WIP is required in order for us to obtain this data, please confirm if this is the case.

I know you asked if we could have a button to clear the build route data, so as to start from scratch.  I haven't forgotten... just haven't had a chance to implement it.

John Brunini <JBrunini@brunini.com>,Kay.Mann@ENRON.com,Law applicable to Enron Power Marketing Agreement w/	Clarksdale,"
Attached is a memo discussing the law applicable to the Power Marketing Agreement.  

After discussing the matter with some attorneys around the office, the unanimous response is that North MS/Delta/Coahoma County is not going to be a favorable venue for any litigation involving Enron.  Juries all over Mississippi have recently become enamored with redistribution of wealth.  The demographics and socio-economic characteristics of the Clarksdale area suggest that a jury trial would not be a good experience for Enron.  

If you have any questions about the memo or other topics, please contact me.  Have a good 4th of July.

After reviewing the password applications available on the Clickpaper and EnronOnline websites it appears that several countries have access to EOL but not to Clickpaper (please see attached).

It has come to our attention that confidential information was disclosed after the EWS PRC meeting this past Tuesday.  We are very concerned about any breach of confidentiality as it relates to discussions in our PRC meetings.

The PRC process is very important at Enron, and it is absolutely critical that confidentiality is maintained throughout the process.  It goes without saying that information discussed during a PRC meeting should never be shared outside the meeting.  The integrity of the entire PRC process is at risk if we cannot trust what is said in the room during a meeting will stay in the room.

The mid-year PRC process is still ongoing and many of you will be attending final Enron-wide meetings later this month.  The process is not complete until these final meetings are concluded, at which time individual feedback should be given.  That feedback should be summary information only specific to the individual.  Information should never be shared about others' ratings or specific comments made about a person.

Please see either one of us if you wish to discuss this further.

Mark Frevert and Greg Whalley

  		SoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused to approve.  We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC approval. 

Hedging:  No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs.  (draft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and passthrough of costs).  Jeff has recommended that we approach the LDCs to begin discussing the issue and developing a strategy to take to the CPUC.  I suggest we develop an ENA-EES hedging proposal for CA and then take that to the LDCs.  I will attempt to put this is writing.

Infrastructure:  CPUC has undertaken a proceeding to determine the need to improve infrastructure.  SoCal Gas and PG&E are responding with proposals.  We want to revitalize the infrastructure and ensure real markets exist and can develop.  Our task is to participate in these proceedings.

"""Rainer, Eva"" <Eva.Rainer@ENRON.com>",chapmagj2@dow.com,Napoleonville land sale,"
Gary,

Per our conversation on July 11, I would like to reiterate that an Enron entity is interested in selling approximately 330 acres of land at the Napoleonville salt dome in Louisiana.  This land is divided into two tracts, one of about 256 acres and the other about 73 acres in size.

Enron recently received $15,000 per acre in a separate land transaction at Napoleonville, and this sets the market price that we expect to receive in the above proposed land sale.  

Does Dow have interest in this land?  Is this price within your range?  If so, I would encourage you to draft a proposal from Dow within the next two weeks, if possible.  

This email does not constitute an offer, but is solely provided for informational purposes.  

Let's discuss this at your earliest convenience.  Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me last Thursday, and I look forward to hearing from you soon!

Given the level of legal conflict etc. in California, and simply because it seems reasonable that I should understand if I have any exposure by being named an officer, I'd like to discuss it with one of our lawyers.  I've heard of D&O insurance, but really don't know what exactly that's for, whether I'm covered, and why I might even need it.

Of course this isn't something that keeps me up at night, but I would like to understand the significance and potential exposure, if any, of being named an officer of these subsidiaries.

Thanks for your help,

Cassandra.

*. The state budget passed the Assembly last night at approximately 6:55 p.m. PDT.  The MOU hearing, which was supposed to take place following the budget debate, was cancelled due to the late hour.  The Senate is on call to take up the budget (SB 739 [Peace]).  There are rumors that Senator Burton will not accept the large amount of pork put into the budget by the Assembly.  The budget must pass both houses before the legislature can adjourn, so it takes priority over the MOU.

*. The Senate Energy Committee is on call of the chair (Bowen) to discuss the original MOU, sponsored by Polanco.  This is expected to happen sometime today.

*. An Assembly vote on AB 82XX is likely to occur in its floor session on Wednesday or Thursday.  An Assembly floor session is scheduled for Friday on the call of the Speaker.

*. Two Republican votes are now needed to pass any urgency measure or the budget on the Senate side because Senator Kuehl (Dem) has gone on vacation to Italy.  Sen. Perata (Dem) may also go on vacation shortly, meaning that 3 Republican votes would be needed.

RJ

The former bill carrying the original MOU, SB 78XX (Polanco), has now
been gutted and replaced with what appears to be the Senate plan (crafted by Sher) for the MOU.  IN other words, the original MOU crafted by the governor and SoCal in April no longer has a bill carrying it.

*. The newly amended SB 78XX calls for the following:

- There is an option for the state to purchase SoCal's transmission assets at book value.
- Revenue from the rate stabilization bonds may be used as follows:
	- No more than $1.2 billion for bank creditors
	- No more than $1.3 billion for debts owed to QFs
	- Any debts for power purchased from non-QF generators before 1/31/01 is the responsibility of SoCal and its parent company.

*. This deal seems very likely to be seen as unacceptable by SoCal,
especially this final point.

BORCO is highly motivated to do this deal and wants to supersize it ($10 million). Jaime's confidential comment to Jan ""was we need to do this deal."" Last Thursday, BORCO had their board meeting in Freeport and all of the PDVSA attendees approved the structure and concept of our deal. Jaime went on to say that PDVSA would look favorably on any term product purchase due to our new relationship with BORCO.   Obviously, the devil is in the monthly storage numbers and our willingness to commit, but we can get very cheap tankage relative to other Carib storage facilities. BORCO is going to revert with monthly fees for one and two turns on all of the following liquid fuels: crude, jet, diesel, gasoline and resid. They are also checking the premium to LIBOR they are willing to pay and if we can lower the interest rate premium they will in turn reduce the storage rate further. 

Please give this storage opportunity some thought and I will soon schedule a video conference to discuss.

Dear Mr Skilling,

Please forgive this interruption to your business day, but I thought it might be time I owned up before you found out from someone else.

A.  I saw you speak at the Tibco conference in Las Vegas and I was inspired.  I've been at Enron for over 5 years, and I think it's fantastic that we using the 'strategy' word more and more.

B. I stole your slides and re-used them for my own purposes.  I hope you don't mind.

C. I think I can see how to move forward with our technology team to build the kind of systems ""structure"" that goes some way to mimicking the capabilities inherent in your new business structure. 

I thought you might enjoy thumbing through ""my"" slides and notes.

Regards,
Richard.

The following table summarizes the PV quantities associated with the three transportation contracts owned by the Navy Yard.  You may use this number to look at the impact of a 1 cent change in demand rates (unitized) on the value of the transaction.  Because pipeline demand charges do not flow as part of the sales price, an increase in the demand charge will result in a loss to the deal.  

As a reminder, the base valuation makes very reasonable (and conservative) assumptions regarding increases in pipeline demand charges over the term of the deal.

The internal cleaning, or ""pigging,"" will begin at the La Paz pump station, and when this portion of the conversion is completed, the project will add about 230 MMcf/d of new capacity by Aug. 31. 
El Paso bought the line from Plains All American Pipeline L.P. in early 2000.  It extends 1,088 miles from Emidio, CA, to McCamey, TX. The purchase also included any fiber optic rights that All American had along its entire 1,233-mile system. 
El Paso was awarded a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission certificate to begin the conversion project in May, and then began a binding open season for additional capacity, which extends through Aug. 2.  The open season is for 230 MMcf/d of capacity from the Keystone and Waha areas of the Permian Basin in West Texas to the California border near Ehrenberg, AZ. The expansion capacity will be made available by adding compression to Line 2000 from McCamey to Ehrenberg, with a projected in-service date of mid-2003.

Welcome back.  The Wyoming Governor's office wants to meet in August re energy issues.  I have identified the appropriate Enron nat gas people.  I would recommend a conference call with your Wyoming contact in advance of that meeting to determine if it makes sense to fly a lot of people to Wyoming.  Mark Whitt is based in Denver and focuses on nat gas marketing.  I believe he has had some discusions in the past with Wyoming re their royalty positions and will likely call to discuss.

Stacey:

I received your name from David Oliver in London, who mentioned that you may be able to answer questions for me regarding how we handle tolling for power in relation to order handling.    I am a business analyst working with EIM on the Logistics project.

I would like to ask some questions on this to understand how my team might relate it to the steel industry for EIM.

Let me know if this time will work for you.  If not, I can reschedule.

"""Calger, Christopher F."" <Christopher.F.Calger@ENRON.com>","""Kitchen, Louise"" <Louise.Kitchen@ENRON.com>",Longview Bids - Confidential,"Louise,

This is incomplete with some bids expected next week.  A lot of companies had a late start due to the 4th of July holiday so they have been whining this week about an extension.  Bids are preliminary and based solely on the info memo.  Bids are in addition to all sunk costs:

McCook Metals - 	$20MM (this is an ongoing, slow negotiation)
PPL Global - 		$15MM
Reliant			$10MM


Indicated that they will submit bid later today/over weekend/early next week:
Calpine
Allegheny
AES
Sempra
Williams
El Paso
NRG
Dynegy

I expect some of these wont show up.


Out for various reasons:
Mirant
Constellation
Entergy
FPL
PG&E
Orion
PSEG
Tractabel


If we end up with 5-6 positive bids, even if they are non-binding, I think it supports risking additional capital to get this project fully developed/sold (DASH in process).  

One interesting note: Allegheny wants to see our offer.  If we have several reasonable bids ($10-$20), it might make sense to offer a high outlier.

I will update.

Here is the DWR revenue requirement, which is good news for creditors.  It is significantly less on an annual basis, $2.66 B per annum vesus $4.2 B to $4.4B per annum shown before.  This difference can largely be explained by the fall-off in spot curves which explains $1.3 B per annum of the decrease.  All eyes will be on the utility's generation rate cases at CPUC on their retained gen, QF and billaterals.

Here are some bullet points for the discussions tomorrow:
-East Power, including Generation Investments made about $50 million in the first half. The greatest contribution came from Ben Jacoby, about $15 million. By the way, I hired Ben along with Scott Healy to acquire sites in 1998.
-All of the traders and structuring, including Bernie Aucoin told me that John Llodra drove both the CMP and NStar deals. Total income $8.5 million.
-I believe Delainey was correct in saying that Ozzie was the brains behind Alamac but Heather did the execution. Total income for the East $7.5 million.
-Most of the rest of the deals were done after I came in.
-Mid market sales have increased.(700% over the first half of 2000)
-This group was in meltdown when I came in(at least on the origination side). I would like to get some credit for stopping the bleeding and starting the rebuilding process in a difficult environment.

It was also clear that El Paso does not have sufficient capacity to serve everybody's full load all the time and they will have to, at the least, credit demand charges when they cannot serve their firm shippers, and may even be required to expand their system.

I am still diving into the depths of Tex-Mex, but cannot see a reason not to proceed with signing the ABB amendment as described in Salsa (4), as this amendment does not cost us anything up front and extends our build option to the end of the year.

There are a number of risks associated with the Presidential Permit process, the possible imposition of an open season by FERC, relationship with CFE, BPUB infrastructure enhancements and service charge structure, etc. which we should discuss prior to waiving our Conditions Precedent under the DeAcero contract on July 31.

Note that if we sign the ABB amendment and waive the Conditions Precedent along with DeAcero on July 31, we will want to immediately issue a Pre-Notice of the Notice to Proceed in order to ensure completion within the 502 day DeAcero commitment.

    are on safe legal ground.  Likewise if they constructed the

There's a large amount of unix software that fits plan 9 just

I should clarify this:  In Unix, most programs take standard input
and produce standard output.  The same is true in Plan 9.  So when
I said the plan 9 model is mostly the same, I was thinking of how
you run programs, not how you write them.  The incompatibilities
are a bit more dramatic from a programmer's point of view.

i disagree.  9P, precise control of the contents of multiple namespaces,
user-level file servers, and the simplicity of the process model
make a big difference in the way one designs
the implementation of both old and new functions
in the Plan 9 environment.  many of the features i listed appear
in some form in other systems, but usually they are sufficiently
hard to use that people don't bother.  by contrast, in Plan 9
they are used almost casually, and to good effect.

>> I should clarify this:  In Unix, most programs take standard input
>> and produce standard output.  The same is true in Plan 9.  So when

a Plan 9 program can also make things visible in a name space,
to allow them to be manipulated by both new and existing commands.
that possibility can dramatically change the design of a program or
system of programs.

Steven Patterson <chesepx@indigo2.gsu.edu>,Group Moderator <christian@geneva.rutgers.edu>,creation vs. evolution,"Hi,
	This is in response to your request for sources on this debate. 
There is a good book written in favor of creation
TITLE: The mystery of life's origin : reassessing current theories
 Charles B. Thaxton, Walter L. Bradley, Roger L. Olsen.
PUBLISHER: New York : Philosophical Library, 1984.

The book mainly addresses the primary origin of life and is rather
technical, being written by chemists.  It also contains a large number of
references, but I would only recommend this book for someone with a good
background in chemistry i.e. at least one year of college chemistry,
though a layperson could read and understand the concepts if he or she
were willing to really work hard.

Hope this helps

forsyth@minster.york.ac.uk,9fans@cse.psu.edu,From addresses and upas,"there might be a compromise.

we went through this here some time ago with an implementation of
the smtp part of upas as mangled by System V.4 and
somewhat unmangled by me.  it seems to be sufficient
to have the smtpd pick the right name to put in the Unix
`From ' header.  since it has already cracked the header and knows RFC822,
it's a fairly simple change.  it takes the `From ' address from the first of
Reply-to:, From:, Sender: and SMTP FROM:.  errors go to the SMTP FROM:.
(there should never be a Sender: without a From: but we get junk mail
from some machines.)

the Reply command in the mail reader just uses the `From ' address,
and needn't mess with the Wilt . (the Stilt) crud unless it wants to.

i didn't understand the recent discussion
until i realised that my From lines were being built as described by
our Unix machine before being sent to me on Plan 9,
and that's why my replies were going to the right address.
it also makes the seemail face list more interesting.

Yes, it should work on an IPC or SLC.  We currently use an IPC as the

Not so.

You need a working Plan 9 terminal, but not necessarily a working
file server.

You can boot the terminal kernel directly off the Plan 9 cdrom.
Set up a unix based file server (using u9fs) on some machine
with lots of disk.

Mount the Unix system somewhere in the heirarchy (e.g., /n/kremvax
is included as a possible mountpoint on the cdrom.)

Copy the kernel sources to the Unix server.
Modify them according to the patches.
Compile, and build.

In fact, we have Plan 9 running here at UO using only the Unix
based file server, since right now there are no spare machines
to dedicate a Plan 9 file server.

Note that there were a few bugs in u9fs as originally distributed,
but Rob sent some patches out around March or April for fixing them.

I had exactly the same problem, to the rescue came Dave Presotto
(Thanks again Dave). The terminal doesn't ever read the nvram, you have to
boot the cpu-server ""/sparc/9sscpu"" instead. This will give you some
error messages, but you can ignore them. Then proceed as per the
instructions.

I could mail you the rest of the help we got from Dave Presotto, if

Not sure what sort of system you're setting up.  If you're running
the PC standalone, you work AT the PC.  If you're using the PC
as a terminal, connected to CPU server/file server, you'd be connected
with ethernet.  There _is_ a SLIP stream module written here
that seems to work, I was using that to connect from home.

You won't need a huge amount of disk space, I have a 120M partition
for Plan9, and that's heaps, probably 60 would be ample, (but don't
quote me on that) (but that's without full source).

I've been busy playing with getting it working with a bootp boot prom,
and using a Stealth Pro graphics card to get 1600x985 screen (essential
or at least very nice for using help) and now have quite an OK terminal.

Good luck getting things up and running (afraid I won't be able to
help you much there, wasn't involved getting things started here).

Ok, I just got a letter written up and signed, requesting the plan 9
licence and CD-ROM and am sending it to Neera Kuckreja today.
My question is: How long does it take for the licence and CD-ROM

The letter is on the official letterhead, + signed by a faculty member.
Would they need anything else?  Eg, photocopy of Faculty ID or something?

Anyone interested in getting comp.os.plan9 should read read the ""How to
Create a New Usenet Newsgroup"" faq.  The URL is:

ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet-by-group/news.groups/How_to_Create_a_New_Usenet_Newsgroup

In general, somebody needs to draft up a Request For Comments, including a
proposed charter of the new newsgroup and make it available.  Then, if
there's any interest out in net land, have a vote.  

I haven't seen a RFC for comp.os.plan9, so I assume nobody has gone this
far.  If nobody else steps forward, I could write up a RFC.

This brings up a point.  Editors on plan9.  Sam is very nice, no doubt,
I've built it on our systems and installed it and now use it exclusively
when at school, but not having access to a SLIP line, can't really use sam
from home except with sam -d, which is not as convenient as using vi or
even, dare I say it, emacs.  What I hope someone can help with, is running
plan9 over a modem without slip, as the TERM program does for linux,
allowing a dialout to an annex box from a home linux box, rlogging into
the main system and running term, which allows X to go over the modems
without SLIP.  Now THAT would make life much easier. 

There are very many vt220/240/100 terminals out there and I don't expect
them to go away very soon, wish plan 9 had better support for them.
I guess a 386sx minimal system running plan9 and 8.5 would do the trick
but I am not sure if plan9 has term or something similar.

Mike Haertel <mike@skinner.cs.uoregon.edu>,9fans@cse.psu.edu,rumours of plan 9 going commercial,"For some reason various people on this list have been
floating rumours about plan 9 going commercial.  I think
this is ludicrous.  At best, wishful thinking; at worst,
confusing to others on the list.

I don't think Plan 9 has any real chance of going commercial.
First of all, the entrenched momentum of the Unix/X11 and
DOS/Windows markets is too great.  I am essentially the
only person here who uses Plan 9; I have tried to find
other recruits, but between a shortage of hardware and the
""what do you mean it doesn't have EMACS?"" syndrome, it is
an uphill battle.

Secondly, remember AT&T sold USL to Novell.  I think this
makes it clear that AT&T doesn't really want to be in the
business of selling operating systems.

So basically, forget it.

However, I think Rob Pike has said that they are trying
to get Plan 9 publicly released.  I assume he means as
free software along the lines of awk or sam.  I believe
this is the only way Plan 9 will ever have a chance to see
the widespread use it deserves, and so I hope very much
that this happens.

Oh god, I think the earth moved for me.
I am drumming up support for plan 9 here, but when I say it
doesn't run emacs, people lose all interest and the weird thing
is that after about 2 weeks of running sam, I would hate to go
back to emacs, and I am a die hard emacs/vi fan.  But most people
don't seem to be willing to take the time to learn sam properly.
People I showed sam to... oh whats the point.

The compatibility list seems to be working, I got some mail about
it, so people, if you have PC's running plan 9, mail me your
configuration/hardware specs and get them incorporated into the
list.

   acme is a better emacs than emacs, because it uses the mouse
   fully, and is a _tool_ that other programs can use, rather
   than a monolith.

Sounds good for mouse exploiters.

But what if I don't want to use the damn mouse?  Call me neanderthal,
but I'm not willing to slow my work down by a factor of 2 to use a
mouse.  Does acme support alt/control/shift key bindings?

(For reference, I touch the mouse maybe 5 times a day... all my
Xwindow focus, open, iconify, etc. are bound to key sequences.)

I'm not in love with emacs... in fact I detest many aspects of it, but
it's far better than all the other tools I have available... and it
lives on all the machines I have to use.

Scott Schwartz <schwartz@groucho.cse.psu.edu>,9fans@cse.psu.edu,Seven reasons why Plan 9 is not my favorite operating system.,"Reason 1:  bitmap fonts.  They have two disadvantages.  First, they
only come in a few inflexible sizes.  I miss NeWS, where fonts were
nice scalable postscript objects. Second, they are hard to read.
(Especially on a 640x480 screen!) If pixmaps were used, the glyphs
could be anti-aliased, with grey pixels smoothing out the jaggies.  To
see what a big difference this makes in apparent resolution, look at
the output of a recent version of xdvi.  It's not a frill, but a
qualitative improvement in, well, quality.

"
scott@cs.ust.hk,9fans@cse.psu.edu,Re: Sam and emacs,"I knew that I was going to regret bringing this up. :-)

Let's see if I've got this right: the Big Philosophical Reason
that the emacs page is blank in the Plan 9 manual is something
like:

  Okay, fine, emacs has wonderful functionality, and is
  extensible, etc, etc...  but the things that make emacs
  a wonderful tool ought to apply to a whole flinking operating
  environment, not an editor, for Pete's sake.  That's exactly what
  Plan 9 was written for -- to be an operating system that does,
  in a modular and sensible way, what emacs does in a horrible
  monolithic way.

So I really ought to be comparing emacs with Plan 9 (and in
particular with acme, which is the part of the whole Plan that
meets the same goals that emacs-as-world-view meets), and not
with sam, which is a very nice *editor*, like God and Rob
intended.

Am I getting close?

Geez, I only just now realized that acme is a pun on ""emacs"".
Rob, can I buy a clue, please?

"
rob@plan9.att.com,9fans@cse.psu.edu,,"there's a background project here to do some scaling font stuff.
we may use them one day, if the results are good enough, on our
higher-resolution (>130 dpi) monitors.  you need the higher res.
the problem is that antialiased fonts are often poor for day-to-day
use because their fuzziness bothers the eye.  programs like nEwS (or
your favorite pOSTsCRIPT interpreter, for different reasons)
try not to use scaled fonts when they can, but rather refer to
precompiled rasterized, hand-tuned, unfuzzy fonts.  the results
are faster, sharper, more pleasing, and easier on the eye.

I just tried it, and it runs twice as fast (around 8 seconds) if I
statically link.  Plan 9 on a lowly sparc ELC runs the test in about
4 secs -- twice as fast again!

I heard some rumor about fork on Solaris taking 1/10th of a second
around the time that we got the SS-1000s, but perhaps this was
fixed in a later release of Solaris.

rob@plan9.research.att.com,9fans@cse.psu.edu,Re: Why compile.c ?,"Why?  Why do by hand what a machine can do just
as well or better?

The SPARC MMU is inexcusably badly designed.
To make a single kernel that supports all variants
one must either write oodles of ugly assembly code,
with loops that must be unrolled for speed, or generate
code at boot-time tailored to the machine at hand.
We chose the latter approach because it's really
less code to maintain.  I wrote the compiler in just
a couple of hours one afternoon.  It's very easy stuff.

Since some of the code must be generated - for
example, cache line sizes vary from model to model -
what the hell?  Why not generate it all?  Easy, and
susceptible to adaptation as SUN's creative minds
continue to design hardware.

I agree.  I want to do even better and print (or at least read) messages
that say which component caused the error.  As you say, that requires
the fileservers to follow some convention for communicating the information
back.  I was imagining hacking the print routines to clip off the 
proposed trailing :number and return it in some other % verb, but even 
without that it would be an improvement just to see the raw information.

(I mistakenly used perror in the example before.  I really was thinking 
about the %r format, but my fingers are more used to typing the other.)

What's new in eu2c-94-07
========================
1. New installation procedure relying on unix make.
2. Support of two compilation strategies:
- total compilation of an application including all the runtime modules
- total compilation of an application using a precompiled runtime system,
  eg. eulisp-level-0.
The former produces very efficient code but the compilation is very cpu-
intensive. The code produced by the second variant is a little bit less
efficient since optimization across the interface between application an
runtime system is not possible, but due to the precompiled runtime-system
the compilation process is much faster.
3. Threads are now supported.

Where to get eu2c-94-07?

              WWW-Server for Ecological Modelling
              -----------------------------------

I have opened a WWW-server providing links to ecological simulation
models and descriptions of these models. The idea is to provide
ecological modellers and other people interested in models an 
easy access to software and documentation. It is also thought for
modellers who want to make their models easily available.

At the moment the possibilities exists to search for models
 - by name or
 - by subject.

Additional this WWW-Server integrates an interface to ECOBAS
(Documentation of mathematical formulation of ecological processes).
[!!!The public access to ECOBAS will be available in January 1995!!!]

Ideally, the server could become a central pool of information
for ecological modelling.

Access:     http://dino.wiz.uni-kassel.de/ecobas.html

At this stage I invite modellers to inform us about links to available
models and documentations (An online fill-out-form exists in this server).
Also any suggestions and information about problems are welcome.

remove extra states correctly you should end up with the same DFA when
your done if in fact L(E1) is a subset of L(E2).  So in many computa-
tional contexts, the question of whether one is a subset or not is not
important.  Put more succinctly, the regexp a|a* is going to result in
the same DFA as a*, if done ""by the book.""

Our lab is trying to relate wind erosion to PM-10 particles and we need
instrumentation to collect PM-10 samples in the field.   We are now using the
mini-vol sampler but would like to explore alternative technologies.   We
hope to find something smaller than the Anderson high-vol and are familiar
with the Cahill's drum sampler.  Are there any other instruments suitable for
ground-based field measurement of PM-10?  
I look forward to any replies.

I've recently joined the list so, as Ted Zobeck suggested, I'm sending
this intoduction.

My main interest is soil erosion (wind, water) as affected by global
climate change. Up to now, my approach has been to run a site model (EPIC)
for 100 years at each of 100 sites in a region such as the US cornbelt, and
 to use a statistical framework to get regional means. I plan to move more
toward a spatially explicit (GIS) approach, mainly because I'd like to know
where the eroded soil goes, and how fast. This is part of a latger GIS
oriented project at this lab which is starting to focus on the Columbia
River Basin in the northwestern US. This involves steep, forested land as
well as rangelands and agricultural lands.

I'd be particularly interested in hearing from people (modellers,
experimentors) who are researching erosion and climate change; erosion on
steep or forested lands; or spatially explicit/GIS approaches to modelling
erosion.

dkuhlman@netcom.com,icon-group-l@cs.arizona.edu,Backtracking in Icon,"An article in the latest ""Icon Analyst"" reported frequency of use
of various control structures in Icon programs, but backtracking
was mentioned only briefly.  When I first learned about
backtracking and goal seeking behavior in Icon I thought,
""Wow.  Now I can have backtracking like I had in Prolog, AND
I don't have to try to write loops and if statements in
screwy ways.""

But now, in spite of the fact that I have a language
with a strong backtracking mechanism, I find that I
don't use it much, except of course, for trivial
constructs like:

    (checkValid(x) | write(""error""))

which I feel I have to write instead of an
'if' statement so that I can feel like a cool Icon
programmer.

Anyway, I'd be interested to know if others use backtracking
more heavily, or whether maybe this is just a ""neat"" but
not so useful feature of Icon.

Or, could it be that the fact that Icon does not have logical
variables, as Prolog does, make backtracking and goal seeking
evaluation less usable?

Ralph Griswold <ralph>,dkuhlman@netcom.com,Re:  Backtracking in Icon,"Backtracking is something that occurs at runtime.  The article on static
analysis in the last issue of the Icon Analyst deal only with static
analysis -- that appears in programs, not how they are used.

Future issues of the Analyst will address dynamic analysis and show, for
example, how many times expressions are resumed to produce alternative
results.

 A couple of months ago I asked about backtraking and got about 3 
 answers.. One was neat example of  course scheduling. I can send it to 
 anyone interested (if the original programmer is not around...). 
 I still think that backtracking is not used and explained enough. It is 
 really a great trick! It is a rather important control structure, and, 
 when part of a language enriches the ways in which porblems are solved.

He didn't say it was impossible to live without backtracking once you have
seen the light, just difficult. I'm not sure what you mean by ""lazy lists""
- I haven't heard that term before, but if I understand what you mean then
isn't using arrays/lists to hold intermediate results then returning to one
of those previous states to continue along another path also backtracking?
That's what I call it, but perhaps I am misusing the term.

Zvi Lamm <mslamm@pluto.mscc.huji.ac.il>,icon-group@cs.arizona.edu,Backtracking is a way of thinking (was: Re: Backtracking),"The question isn't really if you can program without backtracking. Sure 
you can, all you need for programming are those little micro-code 
instructions... 
The question should be made clear: which programming constructs provide 
better tools for us to use? 

Icon is a good language since it give you some important tools that help 
you work (goal directed evaluation, generators, lists, tables etc...) It 
is important to rank the different tools by how useful they are. And I am 
sorry to conclude that since people here say they rarely use it, 
backtracking doesn't seem to be a very popular or useful tool.

I just want to emphesize that this is all part of the larger picture- 
that is what language you use and what it offers. In prolog, for example, 
bakctracking is of the essential... 
Perhapse in Icon we don't need it so much. What do we use instead? 
Lazy-lists? supension? Is this choice of other tools justified? 

These qustions I hope will be answered by some Icon gurus...
